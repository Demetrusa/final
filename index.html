            The Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine 
            was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the "Jedi rebellion," Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, 
            who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, intervened 
            and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Dark Lord.

            Escape from Bracca
            Around 14 BBY,[2] five years after the end of the Clone Wars, former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis works in a junkyard on the planet Bracca scrapping ships from the Clone Wars, 
            but is forced to use his Force powers to save his friend Prauf during an accident. Unbeknownst to them, the event was captured by a nearby Imperial probe droid which 
            transmits the footage to the Galactic Empire, revealing Cal's true identity to the Imperials. The Empire dispatches two Inquisitors trained by Darth Vader, 
            the Second Sister and the Ninth Sister, to take down Kestis. While being pursued by the Second Sister, who kills Prauf, Cal is rescued by Cere Junda and 
            Greez Dritus, and flees Bracca aboard Greez's ship, the Mantis. Cere tells him she is a former Jedi and knew Cal's Jedi Master, Jaro Tapal.
